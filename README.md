Walmart Data Analysis Using SQL + Python 

This project offers an end-to-end data analysis solution to extract key business insights from Walmart's sales data.
It utilizes Python for data processing and analysis with Pandas, and SQL for querying to address business questions through structured problem-solving methods.
The data pipeline is designed using Pandas to extract data directly from Kaggle via the Kaggle API, and the data is loaded into an RDBMS using PyMySQL and SQLAlchemy.
This project is ideal for data analysts looking to enhance their skills in data manipulation, SQL querying, and building efficient data pipelines.
